# Compiling
## Building on Windows
If you're compiling this using `vs_build.bat`, make sure to run the vcvarsall.bat which is somewhere deep in the Visual Studio directory. 

Here's an example of where you might be able to find it:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" x64
